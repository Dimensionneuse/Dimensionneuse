# Dimensionneuse

## What is it ?

The Dimensionneuse is a device which can be used to measure and categorize random materials. 
It is being developped by WAO and WoMa. 

The idea behind the Dimensionneuse is to create a device that would allow us to reference wasted materials. 
Our goal is to encourage reusability of materials as far as architecture, design, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) are concerned.
